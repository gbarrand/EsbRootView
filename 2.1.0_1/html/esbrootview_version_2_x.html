 The version 1.0 was more a proof concept that we can read the ESSnuSB root files (detector and events) and do the connection with the softinex graphics running on most interactive devices we have today.</p>
<p>The version 2.x (2.0.0 released end Sep 2019) comes with more physics and a bash-like scripting mechanism that permits to cover, with the same program, various detectors as the "neard", the "fard" and the "fgd" ones (ESSnuSB terminology at Sep/2019). It comes also with the "show event in time" feature that can help a lot for outreach.</p>
<p>To proceed with version 2.x, the best is to read the further sections by order, it will explain a lot. </p>
