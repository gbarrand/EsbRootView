 EsbRootView is an event display for the ESSnuSB detectors.</p>
<p>The version 1.0 was more a proof concept that we can read the ESSnuSB root files (detector and events) and do the connection with the softinex graphics running on most interactive devices we have today. The versions 2.x (2.0.0 released end Sep 2019) come with more physics and a bash-like scripting mechanism that permits to cover, with the same program, various detectors as the "neard", the "fard" and the "fgd" ones.</p>
<p>An interesting feature coming with the 2.0.0, is the possibilty to see things happening in time for the MCTracks and [WC,Fgd]DetectorPoints (that have timing information in the files). This permits to have a much more strong intuitive feeling of what happens in a detector than with a classical "static" (or "splash") event display. Obviously, this feature is a door open to do very nice outreach videos. (The deployement of rings, in itself, deserves the show!). See the "show event in time" section for more.</p>
<p>If you are "keyboard oriented/driven" and delight to type commands, the desktop versions (macOS, Linux, Windows) come with a bash-like terminal mode where you will find back the good old "echo", the double tab completion, the "history", the variables, the $ replacement, the great backquoting, and some other goodies that make any UNIX so enjoyable. (The 2.0.0 does not have the forever pipe but... it is in the pipeline, if we may say). The idea here is to reuse the power and the logic of bash, which is known by any UNIX pedestrian, and combine it with dedicated visualization and plotting commands attached to the ESSnuSB event and detector models. In principle this should permit to anyone to tune dedicated visualizations with a quite flat learning curve at the level of the scripting itself.</p>
<p>Before starting with a 2.x, you have to read at least the "The setups" section.</p>
<p>The general interactive (mouse and touch driven) behaviour of the app is described in the "App general behaviour" section of the softinex portal. Waiting some specific demos, as the general behaviour of this app is similar to the MEMPHYS_vis and pmx ones, you can see the demos of these on YouTube. Search here "Guy Barrand channel" and then "videos". </p>
